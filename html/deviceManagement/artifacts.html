            <td class="keywordDescription" id="description">There are a few points of interest when dealing with Test Artifacts and integrations for reporting and result delivery.  There are a handful of prepared reports that are already integrated that can be turned on for automatic delivery.  When defining a test run, you can instruct the <a
                hRef="http://www.morelandlabs.com/javadoc/perfectoMobile/deviceFramework/com/perfectoMobile/device/data/DataManager.html">DataManger</a> instance to automatically download test artifacts at the appropriate times using the setAutomaticDownloads() method.  The following artifact types can be used as defined by the ArtifactType enum:
                <ul>
                    <li>EXECUTION_REPORT_PDF: Gets a copy of the Perfecto Execution report in PDF format</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_REPORT_HTML: Gets a copy of the Perfecto Execution report in HTML format</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_REPORT_CSV: Gets a copy of the Perfecto Execution report in CSV format</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_REPROT_XML: Gets a copy of the Perfecto Execution report in XML format</li>
                    <li>FAILURE_SOURCE: Extracts the state of the device and application.  That states is extracted and saved as failureDom.xml to allow for quick debugging of object identification issues</li>
                    <li>WCAG_REPORT: If WCAG operations were used (Branding, contrast, etc) then this will contain the extracted images and their operational statistics.</li>
                    <li>DEVICE_LOG: Extracts the previous 1000 lines of the device's log file</li>
                    <li>CONSOLE_LOG: Writes the console output for the specified test on the specified device.  Only information pertaining to that test/device is stored here</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_RECORD_HTML: Contains a clean execution report of the test steps that were executed.  In addition, a master index file will be created showing the status of all tests executed in this run</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_RECORD_CSV: Contains an CSV based reports of all test steps that were executed</li>
                    <li>EXECUTION_TIMING: Contains a small timing report of elements marked as timed</li>
                </ul>
