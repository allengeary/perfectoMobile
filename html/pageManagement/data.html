				Data-driven testing (DDT) is a term used in the testing of computer software to describe testing done using a table of conditions directly as test inputs and verifiable outputs as well as the process where test environment settings and control are not hard-coded. Data-driven testing is the creation of test scripts to run together with their related data sets in a framework. The framework provides re-usable test logic to reduce maintenance and improve test coverage. Input and result data values can be stored in one or more central data sources. The data comprises variables used for both input values and output verification values. The DDT framework performs "play back" of harvested data producing a powerful automated regression testing tool. While a test may use multiple tables from the data source, only one data source may be used

				Localization for a multi-lingual application is every automation engineer’s nightmare. Internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages however automated tests need to be created to handle the different languages. Content Management is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text for use by the automated test scripts. The engine allows for on the fly content replacement for lookups and verification make multi-lingual support easy to implement.
